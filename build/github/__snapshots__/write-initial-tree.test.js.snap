"# macos-defaults
Uncomplete list of macOS \`defaults\` commands with demos ✨

## 💻 Commands
## 🤔 How do I add a command?
Please update [this file](https://github.com/yannbertrand/macos-defaults/blob/master/defaults.yml) that I use to [build multiple websites](https://github.com/yannbertrand/macos-defaults/#readme) like this one.

## ❤️ I like this website, how can I build the same?
Thank you! I built it from scratch. Take a look at [my report](https://github.com/yannbertrand/macos-defaults/tree/master/build/github#readme) if you want to do the same.

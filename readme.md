`defaults` commands allow you to programmatically set System Settings of your Mac. ü§ñ‚öôÔ∏èüîß

An up-to-date list of [macOS `defaults` commands](https://macos-defaults.com) with demos. ‚ú®

## Add a command

Feel free to open an issue if you know an unlisted command.

It's also possible to add the command yourself by creating a Pull Request. Please take [a look at the contribution guidelines](https://macos-defaults.com/contributing.html).

### How to discover a `defaults` command

Using this [bash script](diff.sh) (`bash ./diff.sh`), you'll be able to find out which key changed when you change a system or app settings.

After you find the key with your options, simply run `defaults find ${keyname}` to find the domain it is saved in.

# macOS-defaults recorder üì∑

Some screenshots and videos were recorded programmatically in the past. Take a look at [the `record` folder in the project history](https://github.com/yannbertrand/macos-defaults/tree/a48f54fe1aab9dd5251cb08a984f4ccf19af6778/record) to learn more about it.

# macOS-defaults builder ü§ñ

This project used to help compare Static Site Generators (SSG). We now removed this part but you can still find an old comparison between a few of them (Docsify, Docusaurus, VuePress and GitHub markdown) [in the project history](https://github.com/yannbertrand/macos-defaults/tree/1716cb77e7c17f8317e18e9b9418cc834bb3486c/build).
